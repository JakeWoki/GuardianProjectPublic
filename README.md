GuardianProjectPublic
=====================
SparkleShare is open-source client software that provides cloud storage and file synchronization services. It uses Github as a storage backend.

At Guardian Project, GuardianProjectPublic is our self hosted, instant, secure file sync for all of our materials that we want to have open and available to the public. You can find our graphics, decks, screenshots and more.
